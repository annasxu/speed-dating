# Speed Dating


Memo to manager --

As you know, the goal of our company is to develop products that help people find romantic partners. To do this, we need to understand what determines whether a person is attracted to another. We have an idea for a project that will help us do exactly that. We will discover the factors underlying attraction, which the company can then use to find better matches for our customers.
	
Furthermore, our project may uncover some interesting phenomena in the realm of social psychology. We will assess the truth of self-images and their stability over time, along with the accuracy of conceptions about others’ perceptions of oneself. Our company could then build upon this research to develop a more competitive match-making product that not only helps consumers find compatible partners faster and more reliably, but helps our consumers to view themselves realistically and positively.

The dataset we are using to help us with this project was found on Kaggle.com. The data was gathered from 552 participants during speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the speed dating event, participants were asked to fill out questionnaires about themselves and their partner. The majority of the data is based on how each speed dating participant rates their date from 1 to 10 on six key attributes (Attractiveness, Sincerity, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests) and how they rate themselves on those same attributes now and a few weeks later. The dataset also gives us demographic data on each participant, like their race, age, hometown, job, income, and hobbies. 

  - What factors predict who they will like at the end of the speed dating event? 
  - Do opposites attract? Or do people with similar characteristics (demographic backgrounds and personality traits) attract? Which characteristics?
  - Does the order in which you met the person during the speed dating round influence how likely you are to want to go on a second date?
  - Do men and women look for different things in a partner?
Do women really know what men look for? Do men know what women look for?
  - How does a person’s perception of his/herself differ from potential partners’ perceptions of him/her? Do people of a particular background have more distorted self-images? Does self-perception change over time? Can a person accurately predict how others will perceive him/her?
  - Are there different “types,” or ideals that individuals are attracted to? 

As we’ve described, our research could revolutionize how our company matches our customers with potential partners. The potential reward is high, and the likelihood of success is also high -- we have everything we need to move forward. We will use tried-and-true methods like classification to separate the matches that will succeed from the ones that will not. Clustering will also help us assess “types” -- if there are what people colloquially refer to as “types,” or a general description of the kinds of people an individual is attracted to. The data has everything we could ask for to not only predict match success, but explore the accuracy of our knowledge about ourselves and others.
